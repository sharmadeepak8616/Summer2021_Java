        Question-1:
        Write a method to sort an integer array
        Example:
        Given array : [20, 10, 40, 44]
        Method should return : [10, 20, 40, 44]
        ​
        ​
        Question-2:
        Write method to find the minimum value from an integer array
        Example:
        int[] arrNum = {90, 89, 91, 67, 87, 88, 93};
        Method should return 67 (because it is the minimum value)
        ​
        ​
        Question-3:
        Reverse an array
        Example-1:
        Given array : [25, 15, 3, 2, 40]
        Method should return : [40, 2, 3, 15, 25]
        ​
        Example-2:
        Given array : [20, 10, 44]
        Method should return : [44, 10, 20]
        ​
        ​
        Question-4:
        Given two arrays,
            first array (marks-array) contains total marks of 11 students of a class;
            second array (names-array) contains their names in the same order as marks-array.
        Create a method which takes both array as parameters, and returns name of student who scored maximum marks in the class.
        Example-1:
        double[] sMarks = {90, 89, 91, 67, 87, 88, 93, 90, 110, 81};
        String [] sNames = {"Happy", "Peace" , "Jesse", "Kaitlin" , "Amir", "Donald", "Steven", "Vicky", "Hannah" , "David"};
        For above example, method should return "Hannah" (because she scored maximum marks i.e. 110).
        ​
        Example-2:
        double[] studentMarks = {90, 89, 92, 97, 87, 88, 93, 95};
        String [] students = {"Happy", "Peace" , "Jesse", "Kaitlin" , "Amir", "Donald", "Steven", "Vicky"};
        Method should return "Kaitlin" as Kaitlin scored the highest marks (97)
